# Gait Analysis
## About this Project

Walking is the first way of displacement for human and essential for daily life
activities and social participation. The human gait can be analysed from several points
of view and specialties. Most gait capture system use direct measurement technologies
to acquire specific motion information, but the subjects natural motion is hindered due
to presence of cables and other components. The coordinates of the markers where
obtained using a simple arrangement consisting of a camera and five passive markers
and a personal computer. The five passive markers are placed on to the body of the
patient and then capture the video which will be processed to detect the markers and
then extract the result in the form of stick diagram of body portion and angle vs frame
graph. From the analysis kinematic gait parameters that is; hip angle, knee angle and
foot angle can be obtained. The main benefits are that it doesnt consume excessive time
and the complexity for a controlled environment to acquire high quality data and also
the effect of markers on the object movement is reduced.
Quantitative data specified by the system can help healthcare professional for better
understanding of patients gait pathology, treatment and rehabilitation.
